steps:-
1. Created a database CompanyDB and an Employees table with sample data.
2. Created a stored procedure GetEmployeesByDept to fetch employees by department.
3. Created a function GetBonusAmount to calculate bonus based on salary using conditional logic.
4. Demonstrated the usage of both the procedure and function together with SELECT and CALL statements.
Output:
